🎯 Built My First React Native App!

I just completed my very first React Native project, and it feels incredible to see my idea running smoothly on a real device!

This simple Goal Tracker App lets users:

Add, view, and manage their learning goals

Use a clean modal interface with animations

Store inputs dynamically using React Native state management

What I learned while building this:

🔹 Setting up a React Native environment (Expo / CLI)

🔹 Using useState for dynamic input and component re-rendering

🔹 Working with core components like View, TextInput, Button, and Modal

🔹 Structuring styles with StyleSheet and applying layout using Flexbox

🔹 Managing component communication via props

🔹 Rendering lists dynamically with FlatList

This small project gave me a solid grasp of React Native fundamentals, component-based design, and the joy of seeing something you built come alive on screen.
